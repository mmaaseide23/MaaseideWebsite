    <h3 id = 'main'> Short Description About Myself - Michael Maaseide: </h3>


    <p id = 'main'> I am a second-year data science student at Northeastern University. I am from Vienna, Northern Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C. When I came to Northeastern University,
         I completed a semester abroad in Greece at the American College of Thessaloniki. This was a very formative experience, but when I started my second semester of college at the Boston campus,
          it made it quite a bit harder to integrate more easily. I was living at the Sheraton, which is pretty far off of campus. This meant that I spent a lot of time in my room after class as it was
           both far away from my friends and it was winter so I didnâ€™t want to spend a lot fo time outside. This made me want to explore new hobbies, and the major one that appeared to me as a result of
            this was learning how to play guitar. I first decided that I wanted to play in February of that semester, and that resulted in me learning that my roommate had a guitar at home that I could
             use to practice, which I did. From there, I eventually got a guitar for my birthday in March and have been playing it ever since. It is something I have grown to be very passionate about and
              I spend a lot of my free time nowadays both practicing and just playing for fun.
