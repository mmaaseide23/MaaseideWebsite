    <p id = 'main'> On this page I will tell you a little more about my passion for the guitar and a little bit about what I know. When I got my first guitar I started with a classical guitar. This specific type is special in that it has nylon strings, which is different from most others as regular acoustic guitars that one might generally think of have steel strings. I started with guitar for two main reasons, they are easier to use to learn how to play guitar, and that they are good for playing spanish music. They are so much easier to learn how to play because of how much lighter they are on your fingers. They require much less pressure to hold down the strings on the fretboard and thus, are much easier to play for people that are just learning how to. On the other hand, these strings also give them a very distinctive sound that is special to a lot of Spanish music. Since I started playing, a goal of mine has been to learn how to play spanish music for my grandmother. I have actually recently accomplished this goal and played her a spanish song very recently that is one of her favorites that I have heard a lot of.
